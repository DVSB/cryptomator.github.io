    title: Transparent encryption
    content: >
      <p><em>Transparent encryption</em> means you will not notice any difference in working with your files.</p>
      <p>While the <em>vault</em> containing your encrypted data resides somewhere in your cloud folder, Cryptomator provides a virtual hard drive through which you can access your files.</p>
      <p>You can work on this drive as if it were a conventional USB flash drive.</p>

    title: Files get encrypted individually
    content: >
      <p>Everything you put onto the virtual hard drive ends up encrypted in your vault.</p>
      <p>Compared to other disk encryption utilities, Cryptomator encrypts each file individually. So if you edit just a small text file, only the corresponding encrypted file is changed.</p>
      <p>This way the synchronization client of your cloud storage provider knows exactly what needs to be uploaded and what doesn&apos;t.</p>

  technicalTitle: The Concept of Cryptomator
  teaser: >
    Cryptomator provides transparent, client-side encryption for your cloud.
    Protect your documents from unauthorized access. Cryptomator is free and open source software, so you can rest assured there are no backdoors.

    title: Easy and Reliable

      <p>We understand simplicity as a key aspect of security. With Cryptomator you don't have to deal with accounts, key management, cloud access grants or cipher configurations. Just choose a password and you're ready to go.</p>
      <p>You don't even need to specify what cloud you use. Cryptomator encrypts files and doesn't care where you store them. This makes it a lightweight application, which we believe is a huge benefit for reliability. Complexity would kill security.</p>
      <p>Cryptomator is a so-called <em>transparent</em> encryption utility. This means that you don't have to learn new workflows. Just work with your files as you're used to.</p>
  secureAndTrustworthy:

      <p>Cryptomator encrypts file contents and names using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="_blank">AES</a>. Your passphrase is protected against bruteforcing attempts using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt" target="_blank">scrypt</a>. Directory structures get obfuscated. The only thing which cannot be encrypted without breaking your cloud synchronization is the modification date of your files.</p>
      <p>Cryptomator is a free and open source software licensed under the GPLv3. This allows anyone to check our code. It is impossible to introduce backdoors for third parties. Also we cannot hide vulnerabilities. And the best thing is: There is no need to trust us, as you can control us!</p>
      <p>Vendor lock-ins are impossible. Even if we decided to stop development: The source code is already cloned by hundreds of other developers. As you don't need an account, you will never stand in front of locked doors.</p>
