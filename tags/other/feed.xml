While most of you have already noticed that we&amp;rsquo;re approaching a new major release of Cryptomator, I think it is time to inform you where we&amp;rsquo;re currently standing and what our roadmap looks like.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="state-of-our-desktop-application">State of our Desktop Application&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We plan to release 1.5.0 within Q1 2020. In our currently running beta (huge shout-outs to all the helpful test feedback), we have already sorted out several problems and feel confident to deliver outstanding quality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While we have already discussed &lt;a href="https://community.cryptomator.org/t/handling-of-long-filenames-in-cryptomator-1-5-0/4191?u=overheadhunter">upcoming changes&lt;/a> to what we call the &lt;em>vault format&lt;/em> (i.e. the layout of the encrypted files and directory) to increase compatibility with some cloud services and at the same time reduce the complexity for certain I/O operations, the far more obvious change affects the GUI:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We did not simply &lt;em>redesign&lt;/em> our UI, we did a full &lt;em>rewrite&lt;/em> of it. Nearly every single line of code that was involved in Cryptomator 1.4.x has been deleted. Why would you do something like this? Well, the application grew over time. Cryptomator has been started more than six years ago and some concepts weren&amp;rsquo;t established back then that make development easier today. During the rewrite, we planned a whole new code structure which makes it easier to extend the application in the future and at the same time have new developers understand what parts of the code is responsible for what dialog in the software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One goal of the redesign was to make the onboarding process easier for users who don&amp;rsquo;t feel too comfortable with encryption software. We attended (and organized) some usability tests in our vicinity and saw how first-time users reacted to the vault creation process. This helped us to design the workflows and understand common misconceptions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="state-of-the-android-app">State of the Android App&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Not worth mentioning is that the Android app in 1.5.0 will support vault format 7. In the Android app, we focused on implementing new features and improving stability:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Already opened files are cached on the smartphone. When reopened and if the file has not changed in the cloud, the file is loaded from the local file system, which leads to a huge performance improvement.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed and improved auto photo upload e.g., after device reboot or on Android 10 under certain conditions the upload didn’t work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We added an option to lock a vault immediately when Cryptomator is closed or in background&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Last but not least, we&amp;rsquo;ve put a lot of work into a new license store that will enable us to provide an alternative way of distributing our Android app, as we have a lot of requests from users who prefer not to use Google services such as the Play Store&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="state-of-the-ios-app">State of the iOS App&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The iOS app will also support vault format 7, obviously. There are some further fixes and improvements under the hood, but no new features. It already supports caching and it you can even buy it without using the Google Play Store. 😉&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-missing-for-the-final-release-of-150">What is missing for the final release of 1.5.0?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While at the time of writing this, there are only few missing features planned for 1.5.0 (such as vault recovery) and only some final polishing is required from our side, we want to make sure our mobile apps and also third party apps such as Cyberduck are ready to deal with the new vault format, too. For some bugs scheduled for 1.5.0 (such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/986">this one&lt;/a>), we&amp;rsquo;re currently waiting for an upstream fix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simultaneously, we&amp;rsquo;re preparing new documentation pages for 1.5.0 as well as a new website with a new FAQ section and we integrate &lt;a href="https://community.cryptomator.org/t/localization-of-cryptomator-1-5-0/4269?u=overheadhunter">new translations&lt;/a> added by our great community on a regular basis.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-up-next">What&amp;rsquo;s up next?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our first priority right after 1.5.0 is to migrate from Java 11 to Java 14. Java 14 includes a long-awaited new tool that is required for our packaging. We&amp;rsquo;re currently using a workaround that prevents us from upgrading to the latest bundled JRE. This is a small change that will probably be shipped right with 1.5.1. However, we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to dig up new holes right before 1.5.0 and decided to postpone this to 1.5.1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, we want to focus on Flatpak. We ditched &lt;code>.deb&lt;/code> and &lt;code>.rpm&lt;/code> files some time ago and replaced them with AppImages. We also really like how the Flatpak ecosystem is gaining traction and is supported natively by a steadily increasing number of distributions. So far, &lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/729">we didn&amp;rsquo;t get Cryptomator working&lt;/a> due to the complexity behind the file system mounts. But after we&amp;rsquo;ve finished 1.5.0, we hope to be able to put some more attention to this and solve this to ship Cryptomator as a Flatpak soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the Android app, the next big feature will be accessing files of a Cryptomator vault inside other apps using a DocumentProvider. For example, a file explorer will be able to access the content of the vault in this way. As well as smaller features like recursive upload of folders to the vault are planned.&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://cryptomator.org/blog/2020/02/12/roadmap/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://cryptomator.org/blog/2020/02/12/roadmap/</guid><category>cryptomator</category><category>desktop</category><category>android</category></item><item><title>Cryptomator Roadmap Mid 2019</title><description>&lt;p>We would like to take a more regular look at our roadmap to publicly document the past, present, and future developments of Cryptomator. Unlike before, we&amp;rsquo;re also going to have a look at the roadmaps of our mobile apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="desktop">Desktop&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the desktop area, we are currently pursuing two different branches: On the one hand we are striving for feature completion of 1.4.x, with 1.4.12 already available as a release candidate. It will finally allow Linux users to store their password in the system and include the much desired &amp;ldquo;Custom Mount Flags&amp;rdquo; feature.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Save password in system (Linux):&lt;/strong> For a long time, you could only store your vault&amp;rsquo;s password in the system under macOS and Windows. Through a community contribution, this is now finally also possible under (some) Linux systems. 😄 The existence of GNOME Keyring or another keychain via Secret Service API is required. Many thanks to Ralph Plawetzki (purejava on GitHub) and Sebastian Wiesendahl (swiesend on GitHub) for the implementation!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Custom Mount Flags:&lt;/strong> Cryptomator uses default options to mount a drive (both for Dokany and FUSE) that we chose for security or performance reasons. However, this leads to limited functionality in some cases and users who want to set their own options can now change them. Be aware: &lt;em>Use at your own risk!&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>On the other hand the implementation of 1.5.0 has already started. For 1.5.0, as announced, we want to fully concentrate on the redesign of the user interface and improve the internal processing of Cryptomator, because like many open-source projects it has grown organically over time and therefore needs a good refactoring. 😉&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ios">iOS&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After the release of Cryptomator 1.4.0 for iOS with built-in cache functionality, which on the one hand avoids repeated downloading of files and on the other hand allows (limited) offline access, the work on Cryptomator 1.5.0 for iOS has started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main focus will be the integration into the Files app of iOS. The first step will be the expansion of our &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/FileProvider.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Document Provider&lt;/a> which is going to be extended by the methods &amp;ldquo;Open&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Move&amp;rdquo;. This will make a direct access to files within a Cryptomator vault from other apps possible without having to copy them back and forth.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="android">Android&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cryptomator 1.4.0 for Android is currently being finalized with the following features, which can already be tested in a beta version:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Automatic photo upload:&lt;/strong> After activation, all images created on the smartphone will be uploaded the next time the selected vault is unlocked.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Make files writable by third-party apps:&lt;/strong> Files that are opened can be edited in third-party apps. When you finish the editing process by saving and returning to the Cryptomator app, the changes are transferred to the cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We are considering these features for future versions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>LRU Cache:&lt;/strong> To save network traffic, certain server responses are cached to avoid repeated downloading, for example of unmodified images from the cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Support for Google Team Drives:&lt;/strong> Access to vaults located in Google Team Drive should be made possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Distribution of the app outside of Google Play:&lt;/strong> Cryptomator for Android should also be available from alternative sources. We are thinking about setting up a licensing system, through which a license could be purchased directly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Unlocking with system password:&lt;/strong> You should be able to use the system password of the smartphone to open vaults. (Similar to unlocking with a fingerprint.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Access to files via DocumentProvider:&lt;/strong> Access to a Cryptomator vault inside other apps should be made possible via a DocumentProvider. For example, a file explorer would then be able to access the vault in this way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Upload of directories (recursive):&lt;/strong> The download of whole folders already works, the upload including all subfolders is not possible yet.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://cryptomator.org/blog/2019/07/21/roadmap/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://cryptomator.org/blog/2019/07/21/roadmap/</guid><category>cryptomator</category><category>desktop</category><category>ios</category><category>android</category></item><item><title>Cryptomator Roadmap Early 2019</title><description>&lt;p>Hey it&amp;rsquo;s a new year, so here comes our &lt;del>quarterly&lt;/del> annual 🙈 roadmap preview.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="openjdk-and-openjfx">OpenJDK and OpenJFX&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Until now we&amp;rsquo;ve been using Oracle JDK, since this included the GUI library we used for Cryptomator: JavaFX. Beginning with JDK 11, we plan to switch to OpenJDK and OpenJFX. JavaFX will no longer be included in the Oracle JDK anyway and OpenJFX promises shorter release cycles and - as the name suggests - is developed in an open process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since we no longer depend on non-free software, Cryptomator could theoretically move from &amp;ldquo;contrib&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; in Debian repos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also hope that building Cryptomator becomes easier, since OpenJFX is a normal dependency and you no longer need to install the Oracle JDK.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="symlinks">Symlinks&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We have successfully moved to FUSE (Linux and macOS) and Dokany (Windows). Now it is time to improve the file systems. One of the most asked features is support for symbolic links. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what this is, don&amp;rsquo;t worry. For everyone else: Stay tuned for a 1.4.x update introducing symlinks.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ui-redesign">UI Redesign&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We plan to redesign the whole user interface from scratch with Cryptomator 1.5.0. In order to do this, we are happy to get your input. If you have any ideas on how Cryptomator should look, feel free to join the discussion in our &lt;a href="https://community.cryptomator.org/t/ui-redesign-thread/2850">redesign thread&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://cryptomator.org/blog/2019/01/14/roadmap/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://cryptomator.org/blog/2019/01/14/roadmap/</guid><category>cryptomator</category><category>desktop</category></item><item><title>Cryptomator 1.4.0 Release</title><description>&lt;figure class="text-center my-8">

&lt;p>As you know, we&amp;rsquo;re providing Cryptomator as a pay-what-you-want software and we want to keep it that way. In the meantime, we&amp;rsquo;ve grown to a small team working full time on this project. And we all need to pay our bills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore we need your help! If you use Cryptomator in your company or know a company that uses open-source software, please ask if they want to become an official sponsor of Cryptomator. Alternatively, you can support Cryptomator through &lt;a href="https://cryptomator.org/sponsors/#donate">recurring donations&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have prepared three sponsoring plans with different benefits for you. Head on to our &lt;a href="https://cryptomator.org/sponsors/">sponsors page&lt;/a> for more information.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="fuse">FUSE&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The biggest upcoming change is the implementation of FUSE-based drives. This will be &lt;em>additional&lt;/em> to WebDAV and will become the new default setting. We are currently developing the &lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/fuse-nio-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">necessary library&lt;/a>. It is based on &lt;a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/jnr-fuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jnr-fuse&lt;/a>, which means you need &lt;em>FUSE for macOS&lt;/em> or &lt;em>WinFsp&lt;/em> in case of Windows. The Linux kernel supports FUSE out of the box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A big challenge at the moment is how to include &lt;em>WinFsp&lt;/em> or &lt;em>FUSE for macOS&lt;/em> in the installer. First test versions will therefore require manual installation of named libraries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The benefit of using FUSE lies not only in performance enhancements (which are already clearly measurable in the current state of development for some file/directory operations) but also in the expected increase in compatibility with third-party software. There are several problems related to the WebDAV drive, as can be seen in &lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues?q=is%3Aopen&amp;#43;is%3Aissue&amp;#43;label%3Amisc%3Awebdav" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our issues list&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="java-9">Java 9&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>During the Christmas holidays, I made all libraries and the desktop application compatible with Java 9. Our &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/cryptomator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CI builds&lt;/a> now run uniformly with JDK 9 in containers. However, the code is still compiled for older Java versions, not just because our Android app depends on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s the point? Java 9 is a huge step in the development of the Java platform. In addition to various bug fixes that directly benefit Cryptomator users, e.g. better support for HiDPI displays under Windows and Linux, there were massive refactorings which form the basis for a new release model of the Java platform with new &lt;a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/faster-and-easier-use-and-redistribution-of-java-se" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature releases in six-month cycles&lt;/a>. This means that we will be able to benefit from new features in the future more rapidly without having to rely on unstable test versions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the conversion to Java 9 with Cryptomator 1.4.0 is also the basis for the use of the Java Platform Module System from Cryptomator 1.5.0 onwards, whereby &lt;a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/275" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much smaller applications&lt;/a> can be built. In a first test, the size of the Cryptomator application for macOS was reduced from over 200 MiB (in the installed state) to about 70 MiB.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="intellij">IntelliJ&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We switched our build platform from Eclipse to IntelliJ because the JDK 9 compatible versions of Eclipse contain changes to the compiler that didn&amp;rsquo;t get along with code generated by &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/dagger/issues/949" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dagger&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, our Android developers are already used to IntelliJ so that we can harmonize our tools a little bit here.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="64-bit">64 Bit&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since both WinFsp and JDK 9 require 64 bit, Cryptomator will no longer support 32 bit systems as of version 1.4.0. Although this is a pity, it also speeds up the development process because fewer systems have to be tested.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cryptomator 1.3.x will be 100% compatible with 1.4.0. This means that users who depend on 32-bit software can continue to use Cryptomator vaults.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Did you find this insight interesting? Should we give an outlook for every major milestone in the future? We would like to hear your opinion in the comments!&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://cryptomator.org/blog/2018/01/07/roadmap/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://cryptomator.org/blog/2018/01/07/roadmap/</guid><category>cryptomator</category><category>desktop</category></item><item><title>Guest Post: Why Easy Encryption Is Safe Encryption</title><description>&lt;p>Another day, another data breach.

This is certainly the case here – such a scale of data loss is unprecedented in Australia, if not elsewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The breach is also typical in another way: it was caused by human error. Several government agencies had been working with a &amp;ldquo;third party contractor&amp;rdquo;, and it was this company who were responsible for the leak. They remain unnamed, which is lucky for them, given the reputational damage that can be caused by breaches like this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a practical level, the leak was caused by … drum roll please … an incorrectly configured cloud storage service. Sounds familiar, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And whilst I don&amp;rsquo;t know precisely what &amp;ldquo;incorrectly configured&amp;rdquo; means in this particular context, I can make a good guess. My bet would be that the data in the cloud was not encrypted, or at least was not encrypted in transit to the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Further, I assume that whichever &amp;ldquo;third party contractor&amp;rdquo; we are dealing with here had policies that required employees to encrypt data before sending it anywhere. They were dealing with sensitive records, after all, and anything else would have been remiss.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="human-error">Human Error&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This might sound like idle speculation, but I raise it to make a serious point: &lt;a href="https://www.dataprivacymonitor.com/cybersecurity/deeper-dive-human-error-is-to-blame-for-most-breaches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the majority of data breaches are caused by human error&lt;/a>. Research by Data Privacy Monitor found that in 2015, 37% of &lt;a href="http://e.bakerlaw.com/s/916f16a49296140a9d10ee92cc567ebd16e76582" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data loss was the direct cause of human error&lt;/a>. And it gets worse – if you broaden the definition of &amp;ldquo;error&amp;rdquo; to include falling for phishing scams, fully 59% of all data breaches fall into this category.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, it could be argued that almost all incidents of data breach are the result of human error. The other categories mentioned in the same research are (24%), external theft (17%), vendors (14%), internal theft (8%), and lost or improper disposal (6%). Barring internal theft, pretty much all of these categories rely on human error: external theft is made possible by employees leaving their laptops on trains, and by not having them encrypted, for instance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given this, it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising that analyses of the &lt;a href="https://www.venafi.com/blog/7-data-breaches-caused-human-error-did-encryption-play-role" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest data breaches in recent years&lt;/a> have pointed to the role of human error. In most cases, a phishing attack is used to gain access to protected data, but in a sizeable minority the problem is simply that once basic access to a system is achieved, an attacker has access to everything, because nothing is encrypted.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="human-ignorance">Human Ignorance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to suggest that everybody is stupid, or that it is easy to spot a sophisticated phishing attack. Even many of Sony&amp;rsquo;s top executives &lt;a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/latest-security-news/sony-hackers-used-phishing-emails-to-breach-company-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell foul of such an attack&lt;/a>, of course, back in 2014.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, the problem lies with the generally poor level of knowledge on security issues, and nowhere is this more apparent than when it comes to encryption. If you work in tech, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget that people don&amp;rsquo;t understand encryption, despite the innumerable and &lt;a href="https://thebestvpn.com/cryptography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent guides&lt;/a> available.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="my-8">

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In my experience, the majority of employees (and perhaps people) fall into two categories. There are those that think that their because they need to enter a Gmail password (sometimes), all their emails are safe as long as they keep their password secret. Or maybe just share it with a few friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then there are those, more nihilistic, who figure that the government / hackers / the illuminati / whoever can see everything that is happening anyway, so security is pointless in any case. I remember that several friends were amazed &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/10/23/fbi-unable-to-crack-6900-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when the FBI couldn&amp;#39;t get into encrypted iPhones&lt;/a> a few years ago – they had assumed that the government could &lt;em>always&lt;/em> get around &lt;em>every&lt;/em> security feature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This type of person is more difficult to encourage into good security habits, but the approach for both types of people should be the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="make-encryption-simple">Make Encryption Simple&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll let you into a little secret: I don&amp;rsquo;t encrypt all my emails. Some, sure. But if I&amp;rsquo;m just writing to my mother about Christmas, I don&amp;rsquo;t bother: call me lazy, but it&amp;rsquo;s just too much hassle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My personal files are a different matter. I&amp;rsquo;m still amazed by people who say something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing to hide, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if someone hacks my computer&amp;rdquo;. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a dissident in an oppressive regime to be damaged by a data leak. Emails, purchasing history, even your contact list, can easily be used to impersonate you online, even if there is no incriminating data there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are endless guides about how to encourage employees, friends, your gran, to store and send data safely. Many point out that proper training and education can bring home to people the importance of encryption. This might be true, but to my mind the most factor in getting people to use encryption is to make it easy to do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ideally, what you need is an encrypted local drive, and one that is easy to move files in and out of. There are plenty of services available that work just like Dropbox or similar storage services, but automatically encrypt files as they are uploaded. Using these, encryption becomes second nature, and if files are encrypted locally you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about sending them to cloud storage or anything else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And best of all, you need &lt;em>zero&lt;/em> knowledge about how encryption works. I would recommend, of course, reading about what you are actually doing when you encrypt files, but for the non-techies out there, making encryption simple is by far the best way of making it ubiquitous.&lt;/p>

Its core components are now modularized to &lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptoLib&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptoFS&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/webdav-nio-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WebDAV-NIO-Adapter&lt;/a>. A complete list of closed issues is available &lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/milestone/26?closed=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="improvements">Improvements&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Auto-Unlock!!! 🎉 (&lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/40" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#40&lt;/a>) We finally implemented the most-wished feature. Still experimental and will be completed by autostart (optionally hidden) in future versions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New vault format 6 (&lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/521" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#521&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added new options to &amp;ldquo;unlocked&amp;rdquo; screen: Mount/unmount without locking/unlocking (&lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#452&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Network access now filtered by the socket instead of the application (&lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/431" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#431&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can now change the socket port without restarting Cryptomator&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New log system with log file rotation and exposed, user-adjustable configuration&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="windows">Windows&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Removed IPv6 flag, Windows will now always mount &lt;code>cryptomator-vault&lt;/code> which is mapped to &lt;code>127.0.0.1&lt;/code> (&lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#512&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/529" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#529&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="macos">macOS&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Improved macOS Sierra integration, unlocking doesn&amp;rsquo;t ask for username/password for &lt;code>localhost&lt;/code> anymore (&lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/170" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#170&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improved iCloud Drive compatibility (&lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#364&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed slow startup on some systems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added &lt;code>CMD+,&lt;/code> shortcut for preferences&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="misc">Misc&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Changed license to GPLv3&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dropped SHA-1 signatures in Windows Authenticode code signing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dropped official Windows Vista support&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dropped official Ubuntu Vivid and Wily support&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="technical-details-on-windows-mounting">Technical Details on Windows Mounting&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>After we have fixed &lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/431" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#431&lt;/a>, we noticed various issues on Windows. We tried hosting the virtual drive via &lt;code>localhost&lt;/code>, &lt;code>127.0.0.1&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>::1&lt;/code> but every host has its own issue: Sometimes access to the virtual drive was extremely slow, sometimes Windows showed unnecessary security warnings (&lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/529" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#529&lt;/a>), and sometimes Office didn&amp;rsquo;t properly work (&lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#512&lt;/a>). That&amp;rsquo;s why the Windows installer for Cryptomator now writes the new host &lt;code>cryptomator-vault&lt;/code> (which is mapped to &lt;code>127.0.0.1&lt;/code>) into the &lt;code>hosts&lt;/code> file. Weirdly enough, with that new host, all problems seem to be gone. Even though we don&amp;rsquo;t quite understand why binding an IP has such a big impact, we just hope that we finally found a good solution!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="under-the-hood-improvements">Under-The-Hood Improvements&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to highlight some improvements that we were able to make under-the-hood: Faster build times, high test coverage for our crypto libraries, and more!&lt;/p>
