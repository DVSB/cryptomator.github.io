      <h1 class="mt-0 mb-0">Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
    </header>
    <p><em>Effective date: April 2020</em></p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">By purchasing licenses and using software licenses and other digital content offered on this website, you declare your agreement with the following Terms & Conditions (T&C) of Skymatic GmbH in the context of current and future business relations.</p>
<h3 id="1-validity">§1 Validity</h3>
<p>These T&amp;C apply in the version valid at the time of conclusion of the contract for the purchase of licenses and the use of software licenses and digital content offered by Skymatic GmbH (Skymatic) on this website and made available to its contractual partners (customers). Deviating conditions of the contracting party do not apply unless Skymatic has expressly agreed to them in writing.</p>
<p>Additional agreements, supplements, and amendments made with the customer in individual cases must be in writing to be effective. Only the managing directors of Skymatic GmbH are entitled to do so.</p>
<p>Business relations are subject to the law of the Federal Republic of Germany. The provisions of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply. If the contractual partner is a merchant, a legal entity under public law, or a special fund under public law, the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this contract is the registered place of business of Skymatic GmbH. The same shall apply if the residence or habitual abode of the contractual partner is outside of Germany at the time of filing a suit.</p>
<h3 id="2-offer-and-conclusion-of-contract">§2 Offer and Conclusion of Contract</h3>
<p>Contents presented on this website and their price markings do not constitute a legally binding offer of contract. By ordering the contents, the customer bindingly declares that he wants to purchase the contents, whereby in case of &ldquo;pay what you want&rdquo; offers, he sets the price himself. Only upon acceptance of this offer by Skymatic, the contract becomes effective.</p>
<p>The customer may reject and correct all entries made before the binding submission of the order or cancel the order process by leaving the site.</p>
<p>In the course of ordering, the customer has the opportunity to see and print out the order overview and these T&amp;C. After conclusion of the contract, the text of the contract is not stored by Skymatic GmbH and is no longer accessible to the customer.</p>
<h3 id="3-prices-value-added-tax-payment">§3 Prices, Value-Added Tax, Payment</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, the prices quoted include the statutory value-added tax and other price components.</p>
<p>Skymatic may, at its sole discretion, change the content and prices offered without giving reasons and without prior notice, or discontinue the sale of the content.</p>
<p>The provision of content is always subject to advance payment. Payment is made by PayPal, Visa, or MasterCard. The reference currency is Euro. Other currencies offered are converted at the daily market rates.</p>
<p>Invoices are issued by a payment service provider and can be accessed online at any time. A corresponding link will be sent to the customer after conclusion of the contract to the email address provided by him.</p>
<h3 id="4-provision-and-reimbursement-of-digital-contents">§4 Provision and Reimbursement of Digital Contents</h3>
<p>Digital content will be made available to the customer exclusively by electronic means after receipt of payment. For this purpose, the customer will be sent an email containing the content directly or a link to access the content.</p>
<p>Paid digital contents are generally not refundable. Any refunds or credits are at the sole discretion of the company.</p>
<h3 id="5-scope-of-licence">§5 Scope of Licence</h3>
<p>The content offered by Skymatic is licensed, not sold. All content is protected by copyright and other legal provisions for the protection of intellectual property.</p>
<p>Skymatic grants the customer a non-exclusive and non-sublicensable right to use the ordered content and expressly prohibits its reproduction and further distribution without written permission.</p>
<p>If the licensed content extends the functional scope of a product purchased under another license, the original license terms remain unaffected. This applies in particular to open-source products provided by Skymatic, for which the respective open-source licenses apply.</p>
<h3 id="6-liability-warranty">§6 Liability (Warranty)</h3>
<p>Skymatic is liable for material defects and defects of title within the scope of legal provisions. The customer shall notify Skymatic of any defects within the warranty period of two years.</p>
<p>Liability is limited to licenses purchased in the online shop. If a licensed content extends the functional scope of a product purchased under another license, liability is limited to the extended functional scope. This applies in particular to open-source products provided by Skymatic, for which liability is regulated in the respective open-source licenses.</p>
<p>Some products provided by Skymatic encrypt data with a key that is exclusively known to the user. You acknowledge that Skymatic has no possibility of recovering lost data or passwords. You further acknowledge that the purpose of encryption is to protect privacy, but that it does not provide any technical protection against the loss of data. Skymatic is not liable for the loss of data that could have been avoided by data backups on the part of the user.</p>
<p>In case of slightly negligent breaches of duty, Skymatic&rsquo;s liability is limited to the foreseeable, contract-typical, direct average damage according to the type of goods. This also applies to slightly negligent breaches of duty by a legal representative or vicarious agent of Skymatic. Skymatic shall not be liable for slightly negligent breach of insignificant contractual obligations.</p>
<p>In no case shall the company&rsquo;s liability to you exceed the amount you originally paid for the product.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the statutory warranty regulations apply.</p>
<h3 id="7-data-protection">§7 Data Protection</h3>
<p>Skymatic processes data required in the context of the conclusion of the contract in accordance with the statutory provisions and our <a href="/privacy/">privacy policy</a>.</p>
<h3 id="8-severability-clause">§8 Severability Clause</h3>
<p>Should individual clauses of these contractual conditions or any individual agreements concluded alongside them be invalid in whole or in part, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining clauses. The invalid clause will be replaced by another one which comes closest to the economic purpose of the invalid provision and which is itself valid.</p>
<h2 id="cancellation-policy">Cancellation Policy</h2>
<p>Consumers are entitled to a right of revocation in accordance with the following provisions, whereby a consumer is any natural person who concludes a legal transaction for purposes that can predominantly be attributed neither to his commercial nor his independent professional activity:</p>
<h3 id="right-of-withdrawal">Right of Withdrawal</h3>
<p>You have the right to revoke this contract within fourteen days without giving reasons. The revocation period is fourteen days from the date of conclusion of the contract.</p>
<p>In order to exercise your right of revocation, you must inform us by means of a clear statement (e.g., a letter, fax, or email) of your decision to revoke this contract. You can use the attached sample revocation form for this purpose, but this is not mandatory.</p>

Germany<br/>
Email: info [at] skymatic [dot] de<br/>
Fax: 02241 / 2667424<br/></p>
<p>In order to comply with the revocation period, it is sufficient that you send the notice of the exercise of the right of revocation before the end of the revocation period.</p>
<h3 id="consequences-of-withdrawal">Consequences of Withdrawal</h3>
<p>If you revoke this contract, we shall reimburse you for all payments we have received from you, including delivery charges (other than any additional charges arising from you choosing a different method of delivery than the cheapest standard delivery offered by us), immediately and no later than fourteen days from the date on which we receive notice of your revocation of this contract. For this refund, we will use the same payment method that you used for the original transaction, unless expressly agreed otherwise with you; in no event will you be charged for this refund.</p>
<p>If you have requested that the services should commence during the cancellation period, you shall pay us a reasonable amount corresponding to the proportion of the services already provided by the time you notify us of the exercise of the right of cancellation in respect of this contract compared to the total amount of services provided under the contract.</p>
